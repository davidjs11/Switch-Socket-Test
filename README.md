# Switch-Socket-Test
Nintendo Switch homebrew app for testing socket connections.
The project state is really primitive, but I'll be updating things as I do it (until I get bored or tired of fighting with sockets).

currently I've done a little client/server program that send and receive a message each other. Soon I'll maybe try to create a little "game" to test if it can be played on a server and have multiplayer and that stuff.



# I FORGOT HOW MARKDOWN FILES WORK. I'LL TRY TO UPDATE THIS AS SOON AS I REMEMBER. MAYBE TOMORROW, MAYBE IN 2 MONTHS... NOBODY KNOWS.......

thx to switchbrew for this absolutely brilliant makefile!! (wow i love makefiles.......(irony)...)
