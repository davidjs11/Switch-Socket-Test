# Switch-Socket-Test
Nintendo Switch homebrew app for testing socket connections.
The project's state is really primitive, but I'll be updating things as I do it (until I get bored or tired of fighting with sockets).
Right now I've done both client and server apps (but really simple, just to test the connection between my computer and my switch).
Soon I'll maybe try to create a little "game" to test if it can be played on a server and have multiplayer and that stuff.


# DID I FORGOT HOW MARKDOWN FILES WORK???? ABSOLUTELY.
# WILL I TRY TO UPDATE THIS????? MAYBE TOMORROW, MAYBE IN 2 MONTHS... NOBODY KNOWS......... (probably when I finish the project)

thx to switchbrew for this absolutely brilliant makefile!! (wow how i love makefiles.......(irony)...)
