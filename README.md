# Switch-Socket-Test
Nintendo Switch homebrew app for testing socket connections.
The project's state is really primitive, but I'll be updating things as I do it (until I get bored or tired of fighting with sockets).

MARCH 1 2023:
- added the first graphical functions (the screen goes from black to red)
- modified the switch app to be the client and send an increasing value in every frame
- created a pc server app that receives values in a loop

MARCH 6 2023:
- added a box that represents the player and moves on the screen
- mapped switch's buttons
- send player position to the server
- changed the input system

TO-DO:
- improve the input

# DID I FORGOT HOW MARKDOWN FILES WORK???? ABSOLUTELY.
# WILL I TRY TO UPDATE THIS????? MAYBE TOMORROW, MAYBE IN 2 MONTHS... NOBODY KNOWS......... (probably when I finish the project)

thx to switchbrew for this absolutely brilliant makefile!! (wow how i love makefiles.......(irony)...)
